# Relational Database Management System

A full-stack application designed to bridge the gap between complex database management and user-friendly web interfaces. Developed as a final project for the "Database Management Systems" course, this project focuses on data integrity, relational mapping, and dynamic content rendering.

## Project Description
The system consists of a robust back-end database architecture integrated with a functional web front-end. It allows users to interact with relational data through a browser, performing essential operations without needing to write manual SQL queries. The project emphasizes efficient table relationships, constraints, and optimized data retrieval.

## Key Features
- **Relational Schema Design:** Structured database with optimized tables, primary/foreign keys, and normalized data.
- **Web Interface:** Interactive front-end for viewing and managing database records.
- **CRUD Operations:** Full support for Creating, Reading, Updating, and Deleting entries via the web UI.
- **Dynamic Queries:** Backend logic that translates user actions into secure SQL commands.

## Tech Stack
- **Database:** MySQL
- **Front-End:** HTML5, CSS3
- **Back-End:** PHP

## Database Architecture
- Implemented Advanced SQL techniques like Views.
- Ensured Data Integrity through comprehensive constraints and validation rules.
